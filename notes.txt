SHORTCUTS 

CMD + T = go to file
CMD + L = go to line #
CMD + Shift + T  = go to symbol – classes, methods



---

NOTES

No API. No need for an API. Therefore no need to worry about routing. 


REQUIREMENTS

Show US states across the top - DONE 
When on a state page, list the cities for that state - DONE

SEO Slugs - change index and lookup - TO DO
Pagination - US state pages
More in-depth data on job objects

Simple text editor with bold, italic, headings

Twitter bootstrap for laptop and tablet styling (don't care about desktop and phones)

Slugs - jobs 
 
 TROUBLESHOOTING 
 If cannot call city.jobs or state.jobs - check models - will be a has_many issue
 
 class City < ActiveRecord::Base
   belongs_to :state
   has_many :jobs (this was missing)
 end

FIXTURES
rake db:fixtures:load
Ensure all ID's are appropriate, else errors.

Multiple nested routes to the same controller.

Nest routes through multiple controllers to DRY up your code
Nested Routes Controllers
https://everydayrails.com/2010/07/13/nested-routes-controllers.html

you’re not limited to nesting a route under a single parent route. Rather, you can nest it under as many parents as you need to. You can also leave it un-nested.

map.resources :authors,
    :has_many => [ :posts ]
  
map.resources :categories,
   :has_many => [ :posts ]
    
map.resources :posts

Solved nested resources issue 
Solution was multiple nested resources to one controller and
parsing the request to determine if :city_id or :state_id and populating differet instance variables

Can stick with Rails defaults in most places due to above. However, need to change some link_to parameters to make them work.

Assume the user will enter the correct state and city - no need to assume otherwise. If problem then solve later.

When I click a state link, I want to view tech jobs for that state

How do I link to: state/:id/jobs? state_job_path

Mon. Nov 28, 2016 - Morning 

*** ISSUE: Not saving city_id for new job in job form

If error message: 
"NoMethodError undefined method `name' for nil:NilClass"
One of your objects doesn't have an id. 
For example, one of your job objects doesn't have a state_id.

Country, state - person 

Right now, no way for Javascript to know which state a city belongs to
